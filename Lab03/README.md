Summary:<br>
This is lab is not likely to the previous lab, beside they all include basic math.<br>
The entire lab is focusing on matrix and different calculations on it.<br>
We need to include our funcitons and test two times for testing it is correct.<br>

Personal lab experiences:<br>
The most difficult part for this lab is the function calls and the debugging.<br>
Like I spent most of the time on getting start about how to properly write it,<br>
and how to I write specific functions like MatrixMultiply Inverse and Determines.<br>
It takes me entire week to finish this lab and I have to go to all Lab sections even though I am in a different time zone.<br>

Feedback:<br>
I think the most annoying part is that there are not enough tutor sometimes and we need more Lab sections.<br>
There are someone metioned in Piazza, the lab section we have is right before the due day.<br>
It is really easy to have someone not being answered before the final day.<br>
Although we have the opinions to turn it in later, but there wouldn't be any Lab section for helping us get through this.<br>
