This lab was the hardest one I think so far. We have to write so many things and test two files base on our self. Plus, there are lots of things from previous lab that we have to catch on such as the state mechine and OLEDprint.

I think the Lab section are stil the best and only effective way to work with. Sadly, I didn't find anything else than tutor and tas that are helpful to me.

I think I learned a lot about this battleship game and fresh my memories about the previous labs. It just a general overview for this entire course.

In my opinion, I think the main problem is the lab sections in this semester. I think there should be more lab section and more tutors on Monday and Tuesday. It would be much helpful than anything else.
