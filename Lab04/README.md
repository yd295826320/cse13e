This lab is basic a learning of how to use struct and pointers. First, we need to make sure the stack is working properly. Then, we need to call the stackpush and stackpop in rpn.c for keeping our data.
In rpn.c, we need to test if the character is operator or a number or something else. If it's a operator, then pop the last two number and calculate them.
If it is number, then push them to the stack. To make sure all the function is working, we need to test all the error message.

The main problem is understanding how pointer and stack works. This takes me awhile to get start with this lab. Then, I just following the last two labs which start a new file and create function. At the end, I made different tests to test all the function is working.

Like I have mentioned in the last lab readme, I think there should be more lab section in a week. For the lab section on Wednsday, I didn't solve my probelm because there is too many people in line. There is about 10 min for each person and I have to wait for 1 hour to get a chance to being answer again. Also, there is only lab section on Monday to Wednsday, this means we won't get any help even we are late. The grace period seems to be not very useful.
