I started with how to connect to the board and have some issues with connecting. Then, Starting with LED_setup and timers. As I went to the lab section, keep working on the rest of the lab.

I think the overall lab is fairly hard. As I am writing this readme I still have problems with the buttons and debouncing. I think we seriously need more sections and tutors on Tuesday. It is impossible to get help with two tutors and 30 students in one section.
