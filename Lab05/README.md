As a result, InsertionSort has a faster speed than SelectionSort. I think this is because the stucture of LinkList make it more efficient to work on remove and insert.

The highlight of this lab is mainly focusing on the stucture of LinkList and how it functional. Furthermore, I think we learned two basic sorting which would be helpful in the future learning.

I started with writing function in Linklist.c and figure how are these functions would work. Then, I get a little bit mess on testharness and sort.c.  If I do this lab again, I would focusing more on testharness at the beginning. The simple testharness would cause error in further steps.

It think it would be helpful if there is more autograder report at the last few hours before the due time. I found out there are lots of students who passed in their MplabX but not the autograder. Since we are grading base on the autograder, if we could get more report on the last few days, it would help us to find out our error faster and more efficiently. In addtional, we truly need more Lab section, and I think Chirs's lab sections are more helpful than Diego's. In my personal opinion, Diego is just less wordy through the section.
