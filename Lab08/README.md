This lab is creating a word base rpg game. I think we mainly learning how to read file and use functions to get the informaion. I used different way to write the LoadRoom other than lab menu.

Firstly, I start with the helper function and get to know what are the use to these function in hear files. Then, start looking at the flow of the file reading and how to skip through the version that not meet the requirement. Then, write in main file for display and check different cases. Lastly, combine everything and makefile.

I spend the most of the week for this lab and majority of the time are understanding what to do. I think the most difficulty I had is on Thusday, there was only one tutor at the time. Only 9 people get helped, and I was on the 10th place. I think that section only give some general help but not the specific help, which cause I don't understand some bug I had at the time.
