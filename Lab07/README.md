I think this lab is a upgrade version from the last lab. It helps us to understand more about UNO32 and how to use code affect the hardwares. I think the diagram in the Lab menu is really helpful which I would follow along but not LEDupdate. The idea of putting the LED update into our state function is from Adam without showing me any code from him.

Well, I firstly look into the Lab menu to check what is the purpose of this lab. Then, start following the diagram to start writing the runOvenSM. Then, I go to the Lab section to find out how to do updateOLED and updateLED. But there still problems with updateLED, so I choice to just write it inside my state function, which would just trun off LEDs by every 1/8 of the total cook time.

I think overall this lab is great but I use extra one day to solve some issue. I think it is a great improvement that there were 4 tutors on Thursday lab. All students got helped and it was not a lot of pressure at the time. But still, I would think there is a Thursday section would help a lot and even it would helps us get prepared for the next lab. For Diego's and professor's section on Friday, it used to be just solving problem and I think it is fair difficult to have serious problem within 1 or 2 days because we have other works to do during the week. So please give us more general idea for the lab. It would help us to find out the purpose of the lab and get start.
